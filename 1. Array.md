## Simple Arrays in Java
Logic of Arrays using Java: Think of it like beads. 
we never actually delete, we overwrite with new value and shift to left. similarly we also insert by moving the beads, creating space.

### Insertion
```java
double a[][] = {{1.1,2.2}, {3.3,4.4}, null, {5.5,6.6}, null};
a[4] = new double[66]; //take a note of this.
//traditional logic and way of insertion into the array. 
```

### Traversal
1. Using for-each loop.
2. Using for loop with - Printf. 

### Conversion Compare Copy
`x.clone()`; // Method returns object. we have to typecast it.


> You can create objects array to store elements of different types.
